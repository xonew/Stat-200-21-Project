    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While some individuals enjoy the convenience and lower price tag of handheld games such as the DS, others may prefer the traditional experience that home gaming consoles like Wii provide.  As the video game industry continues to grow, gaming companies can gain insight by looking at the popularity of these two platforms to decide which direction to launch their next project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the high popularity of console gaming in North America, with over half of American households owning a gaming console *(1)*, we expect there will be a significant difference in the mean game sales, with the mean sales of console video games being higher than that of handheld games. With that being said, we are not confident enough in this claim to make our testing one-sided, therefore, in our project we will be exploring the research question, \"Is there a difference in the popularity of handheld devices and home consoles for gaming in North America?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this inferential question, the dataset we will be investigating is the \"Video Game Sales\" dataset found on Kaggle, by Gregory Smith, with our location parameter being the mean and the scale parameter being the standard deviation. The dataset consists of the sales data for 10,129 games released in North America from 1980 to 2020. However, we chose to use 2001 as a cutoff year because it is the release year of modern milestones, the Xbox (home system), and the Game Boy Advance (handheld). *(2)* There are 11 variables, but we are only interested in North American sales in millions and the platform. There are no missing values in this dataset.\n"

Next, we calculate the mean difference by subtracting the mean sales of a handheld game from that of a console game.  After this, we calculate the standard error under the null distribution which follows the formula $sqrt(s_1^2/n_1+s_2^2/n_2).$  We then calculate the test statistic by taking the mean difference and dividing it by the standard error.  Finally, we calculate the p-value by putting our test statistic and degrees of freedom (from earlier) in the pt function which shows the probability of getting a more extreme value than our test statistic (on either side) under the t-distribution.  The t-distribution is used here since we do not have the population standard deviation and thus have to estimate it based on our sample.  As in our simulation based hypothesis test the p-value is extremely small (smaller than 0.01) and thus at our signficance level of 0.05 we will reject the null hypothesis that the mean sales of handheld games is equivalent to that of console games in North America in favour of the alternative hypothesis that handheld game sales are different than console game sales in North America."

    "Here we have 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference between console game sales and handheld games sales using both the normal distribution and the t-distribution.  Here we used the mean difference and standard error that we found from the prior 2 sample t-test.  Both confidence intervals are very similar which makes sense since our sample size is so large and the t-distribution begins to look more and more like the normal distribution the larger the sample size (larger tails start to thin out and become similar to that of the normal distribution as the sample size increases and the degrees of freedom increase).  Overall these 2 confidence intervals confirm our hypothesis testing as the confidence intervals do not contain zero showing that there is a meaningful difference."
